# ProjectRepairSystem

Institutional Project - IFBA IrecÃª campus

Project developed at IFBA simulating a control system for a medical equipment maintenance company.

For the system to work on the machine, it must contain at least:

JDK version 1.8.0;
SQL Connector 5.1.12;
SQL Service 5.0 or higher.

The user does not necessarily need a JAVA IDE "Netbeans, Eclipse or others" because the .jar file is located in the project's store folder, 
that is, the executable file.
